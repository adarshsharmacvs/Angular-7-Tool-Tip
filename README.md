## About Application

This app is developed to test the tool tip functionality, where we have two buttons where only one tool tip will be enabled at once, if clicked on one button the tool tip will be enabled for the same and disabled for the other (if enabled) and vice versa.

If clicked anywhere else on the screen whichever tool tip is enabled will be disabled, same goes when clicked "ESC".
